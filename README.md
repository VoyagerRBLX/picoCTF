# The Numbers Writeup PicoCTF (Lang: English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)
## Why the Numbers?
The reason why I chose the Numbers as my TechSeed writeup project is because of it's uniqueness. Out of all assignments I did, this one was the most unique because it required me to de-cipher rather than coding or inputting commands. This is by far my favorite challenge.
## Description
The numbers... what do they mean?
## Hint
The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

The numbers in the image are "16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }", This is a form of cryptic code called the A1Z26 cipher (aligns with the order of the English Alphabet) so I recommend you use a "Numbers to letter converter" for this one
