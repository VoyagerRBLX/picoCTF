First up, download the image upon clicking the linked text "number"<br>
The numbers in the image are "16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }", This is a form of cryptic code called the A1Z26 cipher so I recommend you use a "Numbers to letter converter" for this one
<br>Recommended site: https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher
<br>After deciphering you will get the flag: picoCTF{thenumbersmason}
